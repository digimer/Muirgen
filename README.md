NMEA2000 data processor for open source sailing

This is an in-development open source platform being developed for my sailboat. IT IS INCOMPLETE!

The primary goal is to process data from my various NMEA2000 devices, including the custom N2K compatible devices (see: https://github.com/digimer/Mermaids-Rest). 

It will collect data from the Airmar 200WX weather station and DST810 combined depth sounder, speed wheel, temperature and attitude sensor. 

The project is being documented on https://www.youtube.com/@TheDigitalMermaid/videos.
